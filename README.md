# Neural Network From Scratch

I was brushing up machine learning topics and I decided to write a nueral network from scratch since 
  - the theoretical literature doesn't give me the intuition for sizes for various thing such as weights
  - the practical literature fails to explain the reason behind various implementation details
 
Writing this from scratch forces you to understand all of the various details and help me make sense of what is going on under the hood when I use something like keras.
